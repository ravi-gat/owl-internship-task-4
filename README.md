Machine Learning model comparison using Breast Cancer dataset. Visualizes EDA, PCA, feature importance, and evaluates Logistic Regression vs Random Forest using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
# Hard Task 4 — Machine Learning Model Comparison

## Overview
This project compares two machine learning models — Logistic Regression and Random Forest — on the Breast Cancer diagnostic dataset to identify performance differences across key metrics.

## Dataset
Breast Cancer Wisconsin (569 samples, binary classification)
Classes: 0 = Benign, 1 = Malignant

## Visualizations Included
- Class distribution
- Correlation heatmap
- PCA 2D visualization
- Random Forest feature importance
- Model performance bar chart
- Confusion matrices

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

## Results Summary
Random Forest generally performs stronger in Recall and F1-Score, indicating better malignant case detection. Logistic Regression remains competitive and interpretable.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
